## Introduction

This is a template repository to participate in [Alice/Project
Euler](https://github.com/alice-adventures/project-euler).

Please customize it to suite your taste but keep the basic structure. To keep
the basic structure means that:

  1. It must be a subdirectory called `0001-0100` to hold all problems from 1 to
     100.

  2. Problems in the range $[101, 200]$ must be in the directory `0101-0200`,
     and so on.

  3. For all shared problems, a template can be generated automatically in the
     appropriate place. Otherwise you have to create it manually. for automatic
     generation, please check the `alice` command.

  4. As an example, you are provided with the first problem implemented (but not
     correctly solved) and a template for the second one as if it was manually
     generated.

  5. Problems are solved using one o more of the interfaces provided by
     Alice/Project Euler. Review problems 1 and 2 of this repository for more
     information.

  6. Programs to run these solutions can be multiple per interface, depending on
     the available implementations at that moment. For example, one solution
     implemented using the GUI interface could be run using a Gnoga or SDL
     *runner*. This means that there can be two programs to run the same
     solution, based on two different implementations of the same GUI interface.
